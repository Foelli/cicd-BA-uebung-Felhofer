# About me
Simon Felhofer

3 Facts about me:
- I have a cat called "BÃ¥mps" she is very cute and orange. Also bit lazy and loves to sleep.
- I am a software engineer with a passion for automation and continuous delivery.
- I enjoy learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends.
- I like playing video games and watching movies.

CI/CD is relevant for me because it helps automate the deployment process, ensuring that changes are tested and deployed consistently and reliably. This is important for maintaining the quality and stability of software systems, especially in a fast-paced development environment.
